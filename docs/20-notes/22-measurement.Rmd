## Measuring "trust"

```{r get haven, eval=FALSE}
## To import datasets stored in the format of other statistical programmes (e.g. SPSS, Stata and SAS) we can use the 'haven' package (see. R4DS Ch. 11.6)
## Install 'haven' if not already installed:
install.packages("haven") 
```

```{r use haven, eval=FALSE}
## Once you have a package installed, there are two ways in which you can use the functions contained in the package:

# 1. to only use a specific function in one instance, state the package name followed by two colons (::) followed by the function name; e.g.:
haven::read_sav()

# 2. to load the entire package and then use any function from the package for the duration of your R session; e.g.:
library(haven)
read_sav()
```

```{r import}
haven::read_sav("")
```
