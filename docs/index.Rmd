### Welcome to **Advanced Research Methods 1**

This is a 10-week course on applied regression modelling for sociologists, first delivered at York St John University (UK). It uses the [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) programming language and the [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/) Integrated Development Environment. It takes a [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) approach to coding and relies heavily on [`R Markdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) for scripting and reporting.
