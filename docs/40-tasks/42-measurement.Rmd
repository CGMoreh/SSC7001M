## Exercise 1: Describe survey measurements (\~30 minutes)

The first task is to explore the online documentation of three cross-national surveys and note down how "trust" is conceptualised and measured. Use the table below to record your observations.

| Survey name | Variable | Label | Questionnaire question number | Questionnaire question |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |
|             |          |       |                               |                        |

: Measurements of trust in cross-national surveys

## Exercise 2: Download, import, explore, export

The second task is to download the most recent datasets from cross-national surveys, import the files into `R` from their original formats, briefly explore the datasets as a whole, and export them to R's custom binary format called `.rds`.
